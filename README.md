This algorithms was created in one of my ideas to try increasing the smoothness in low fps videos, later i discovered that this idea already existed.


 The logic it's simple, we take all the frames in the video and add between them some frames (the user choose the quantity), this added frames are a transition with opacity between the actual frame and the next one.
